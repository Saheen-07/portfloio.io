            <p>
               Hello, my name is Saheen Askar, and I’m from Aranthangi, Tamil Nadu. I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Rathinam College of Arts and Science in Coimbatore, with a CGPA of 7.5. I am passionate about technology, with a strong interest in coding, data analysis, and web development.

I have hands-on experience with Python, Java, SQL, MongoDB, and front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve built real-time web projects, including an AI-powered chatbot using the Gemini API and a stock prediction model using LSTM and TensorFlow. I’ve also gained practical experience through a data analyst internship at Techno Hacks Edutech, where I worked on data cleaning, visualization using Power BI, and predictive modeling.

I am a quick learner and a team player with strong skills in problem-solving, leadership, and critical thinking. I actively participate in competitions and have won second prize in an inter-college hackathon and a special prize in kabaddi.

Currently, I’m seeking new opportunities to expand my skills, collaborate on impactful projects, and contribute meaningfully to the tech community.

                <p>
                    As a Data Analyst at Techno hacks Edutech, I used Python, NumPy, and Pandas to analyze and 
process large datasets, uncovering insights to support data-driven decision-making. My role 
involved data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency. 
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), I identified trends, patterns, and anomalies, improving 
business insights and strategic planning. I also developed interactive dashboards and reports, 
presenting complex data in a clear, actionable format for stakeholders. Additionally, I assisted in 
building predictive models and conducting statistical analysis to optimize processes and enhance 
efficiency. My contributions streamlined data workflows and strengthened decision-making across 
the organization.</p>

                <h3>Quick Analysis Using Pandas</h3>
                <p>
                   I recently downloaded a card transaction dataset (CSV) and imported it into Google Collab 
for rapid analysis using Python’s Pandas library. 
After cleaning and exploring the data, I visualized the transaction distribution using a Pie 
Chart to easily highlight spending patterns across categories. 
This exercise helped me strengthen skills in: Data cleaning & preprocessing, Exploratory data 
analysis (EDA) with Pandas, Data visualization using Matplotlib & Pie Charts Technologies Used: GOOGLE COLLAB, PANDAS.</p>
